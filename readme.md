# Decode a list of GPS coordinates to adresses 

## What you need 

* Python3 
* Jupyter notebook 
* Some very basic knowledge of Python


## Project specific 

For this test the CSV looks like this  

```

### step 1 

Decode the GPS coordinates and create a database : see coments in ```app.py``` 

You will need the following packages : 
* requests 
    -  ```pip install requests```

* sqlite3 
    -  ```pip install sqlite3```

To visualize the databse : https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/# 

### step 2 

You will need the following packages : 
* jupyter 
    -  ```python3 -m pip install jupyter```

type : ```jupyter notebook``` and open the Adresses.ipynb

Attach the data form our database to our csv and save a new version : see coments in ```Adresses.ipynb```
